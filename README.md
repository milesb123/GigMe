Changing Perceptions about the use of social media
- Social media often receives bad stigma from traditional media outlets and employers causing users to feel the need to suppress their activity. GigMe reframes twitter not only as a productivity platform but as a passion platform:sparkles:. Gigme will mould the mindset of its users to think of Twitter as a place where they can share even more about what they were working on than before in a casual manner, and employers to see the individual for their ability and who they are above what their C.V or LinkedIn can portray.
Show, Donâ€™t Tell
